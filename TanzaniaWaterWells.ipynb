    "The Water Project is a non-profit organization that helps people in sub-Saharan Africa get access to clean water and sanitation. Since 2006, we have been providing training, expertise, and financial support to build water projects in communities that need it most. In Tanzania, despite having established many water points in the region, the country struggles with providing clean water to its population of over 57,000,000. Of the many water points already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether.\n",
    "I have been asked to use data from 59,400 wells to find wells that need to be fixed and patterns in broken wells. This information will be used to help build new wells and fix old wells better.\n"

    "Tanzania, as a developing country has many residents who’s water supply is dependent on the local water wells as their primary source of fresh water. It is therefore important that the pumps are well maintained and remain functional for the well-being of the people. It is for this reason that I was tasked with the role of investigating data and using it to predict the functionality status of wells across the country.\n",
    "The purpose of this challenge is to fit a model which can better determine which water pumps are functional, need repair, or not functional at all, in order to expedite the process of locating, examining, and fixing the pumps.\n"
